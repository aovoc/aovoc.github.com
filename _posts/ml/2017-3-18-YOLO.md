# Introduction    
## current detection system repurpose classifiers to perform detection.   
DPM: sliding window   
R-CNN: region propoal + classifier   

## YOLO Detection System   
1.resizes the input size to 488*488.  
2.runs a single convolutional network on the image.  
3.thresholds the resulting detection.   
## benefit   
1.fast.
2.reason globally about the image when making predictions.
3.learns generalizable representations of object.

#  Unified Detection  
divides the input image into an S*S grid.   
Each grid predicts B bounding boxes. Each bounding box consists of 5 predictions: x, y, w, h, confidence and C conditional class probabilities.  
confidence: predicts the intersection over union  between the predicted box and the ground truth.  
S*S*(B*5 + C) tensor.   
output: S*S*C tensor.   

# Network Design           
<img src="/assets/pics/yolo_architecture.jpg" alt="overview"/>
fast-yolo uses a neural network with fewer convolutional layers and fewer fiflters in those layers.

# Limitations of YOLO   
1.struggles with small objects.   
2.struggles to generalize to objects in new or unuasal aspect ratios or configurations.    
3. A small error in a small box has a greater effect on IOU compared to a large box.    
main source of error: incorrect localizations.   

# Conclusion    
real-time object detection. simple and can trained directly on full images.   
Unlike classifier-based approaches   
1.YOLO is trained on a loss function that directly corresponds to detection performance   
2.the entire model is trained jointly.
